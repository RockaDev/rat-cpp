# R4T
Rat developed in C++. I worked on this project in my free time, my plan was to learn c++ more deeply, to learn working with Sockets and Windows API.
Working time on this project - 5 months

In this project I included -> 
1. File Explorer (can send files from server to client, view files, directories, whole drives)
2. Remote Desktop Viewer (can watch connected client's desktop from server)
3. CMD (run commands from server to connected client's pc, or to run the same command for ALL connected clients)
4. Location Map (showing a pulsing visible red dot on a real map, where the client's country is coming from)
5. Telegram Notify (if client connects, the rat will automatically send a message to a telegram group, as a notify with the clients ip address and other information)

I worked also on the design of this rat. I include photos below.!
